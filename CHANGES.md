# bunyan Changelog

## bunyan 0.3.0 (not yet released)

- `log.child(options[, simple])` Added `simple` boolean arg. Set `true` to
  assert that options only add fields (no config changes). Results in a 10x
  speed increase in child creation. See "tools/timechild.js". On my Mac, 
  "fast child" creation takes about 0.001ms. IOW, if your app is dishing
  10,000 req/s, then creating a log child for each request will take
  about 1% of the request time.
- `log.clone` -> `log.child` to better reflect the relationship: streams and
  serializers are inherited. Streams can't be removed as part of the child
  creation. The child doesn't own the parent's streams (so can't close them).
- Clean up Logger creation. The goal here was to ensure `log.child` usage
  is fast. TODO: measure that.
- Add `Logger.stdSerializers.err` serializer which is necessary to get good
  Error object logging with node 0.6 (where core Error object properties
  are non-enumerable).


## bunyan 0.2.0

- Spec'ing core/recommended log record fields.
- Add `LOG_VERSION` to exports.
- Improvements to request/response serializations.


## bunyan 0.1.0

First release.
